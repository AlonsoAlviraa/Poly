# 🦅 APU (Arbitrage Processing Unit) - Project Status Report
**Date:** 08-February-2026
**Overall Status:** 🔵 PIVOTING (Infrastructure Optimized, Data Shifting)

---

## 🏗️ State of the Core

The system has successfully completed "Operation Mapping Gap" for the sports/crypto legacy phase and is now being refitted for high-stakes **Event Arbitrage**.

### 1. The "Brain" (Graph Engine v2.1)
- **Status**: ✅ **BATTLE-TESTED**
- **Discovery**: Successfully discovered 61 enriched matches in the final legacy run (Tennis/Basketball).
- **Intelligence**: Injected 45 validated mappings into persistent memory.
- **Upgrades**: Now supports Hub Pruning and Semantic Aliasing.

### 2. Matching Engine (Entity Resolver)
- **Status**: ✅ **RE-TARGETED**
- **Changes**: Logic hardened against false positives (e.g., the "Illinois Filter" for State/Univ).
- **Next Task**: Adapting the numeric bracket logic for Kalshi's economic contracts.

### 3. Execution Infrastructure
- **Status**: 🟡 **REFITTING**
- **Legacy Components**: `betfair_client` and `sx_bet_client` are functional but semi-deprecated for the new focus.
- **New Components**: Architecture defined for `kalshi_client` and `event_arb_executor`.

## 🚩 Current Milestone: "Strategic Brainstorming Complete"

We have finalized the technical design for three highly-profitable niches:

1.  **Economic Print HFT**: Targeting millisecond discrepancies during Fed/CPI releases.
2.  **Political Precision**: Using graph intelligence for zero-mismatch election arbitrage.
3.  **Climate Grid Arbitrage**: Solving multi-outcome weather events with polytope math.

## 🚀 Recent Wins
- **Mapping Robustness**: Resolved the 0% match rate in Basketball and 4% in Tennis by structural normalization.
- **Architecture Stability**: The system now handles 5000+ events without latency degradation using the Hacha optimization protocol.

## 📋 Top Priority Tasks
1.  **Code**: Implement `src/data/kalshi_client.py`.
2.  **Verify**: Map the "CPI Series" on Kalshi to Polymarket O/U categories.
3.  **Deploy**: Setup the first shadow run for the next major US economic print.

**Lead Architect's Note:** The sports phase proved the robustness of the matching logic. We are now moving where the real alpha is: regulated macro-events.
